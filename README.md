# Traffic-Indicator-Analysis
Determining heavier-than-usual traffic indicators on I-94.

* Language: Python.
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
* Dataset source: [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project was to analyze a data set collected John Hogue of different traffic conditions on westbound I-94 as measured by MN DoT ATR station 301, located roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN from 2012 to 2018. The analysis was supposed to bring forth tell-tale predictors for heavier than usual traffic around the station.

## Conclusion: 
Through exploratory data visualization techniques, we were able to conclude the following:
* During the years, it is the summer season during which the traffic is the highest.
* During a week, it is usually the weekdays, specifically the earlier weekdays during which traffic peaks.
* During a weekday, it is usually from 7-8AM and 4-6PM that traffic is the highest.
* Moderate or more intense snowfall/hail can cause traffic volume to increase.
